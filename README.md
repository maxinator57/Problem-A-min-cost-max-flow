# Problem-A-min-cost-max-flow
My solution for mincost maxflow problem from the third long contest from AMI CS HSE course Algorithms and Data Structures.
Finds a mincost maxflow for a network with arbitrary edge capacities and costs without negative-cost cycles using Ford-Fulkerson algoritm with Johnson's algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph without negative-cost cycles.
